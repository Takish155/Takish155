<h1>Hi, I'm Takeshi from the Philippines</h1>

<p>I currently live in Japan and was born in the Philippines. I'm deeply immersed in the world of technology as an IT college student, with a strong focus on front-end development.</p>

<p>I'm dedicated to improving my development skills, particularly in front-end development. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey of learning GraphQL and Vitest, and I'm passionate about mastering these powerful tools</p>

<p>I'm also actively seeking an internship opportunity to further enhance my practical experience and contribute to exciting projects. I'm eager to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world projects.</p>

<p>I'm always on the lookout for exciting opportunities to contribute to front-end projects and learn through real-world experiences. I know that excellence comes from hard work and continuous learning, and I'm committed to this path of growth.</p>
